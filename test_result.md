# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Iteration 18 — Scenes, Seats & Avatars.
  Graft the persistent scene architecture from the standalone /gather demo onto real /table/:id
  pages. Persist scene config (room/table/tabletop/food/ambiance/music) on the Table document,
  add fixed seat slots per table type with claim/leave endpoints, broadcast scene + seat changes
  over WebSocket, and reserve namespace for `premium_illustrated` + `photoreal` avatar tiers
  (no UI ships for those — only the enum value, optional User field, and a Settings indicator).

Same-seat-count swaps (e.g. mahogany→drafting, both 8) skip truncation entirely. Two new tests in TestTableShrinkTruncation prove the truncation path AND the no-false-positive path.

        Iteration 18 complete. Shipped:
          • Scene fields on Tables (room/table/tabletop/food/ambiance/music) with DEFAULT_SCENE for new and legacy tables.
          • table_seats collection with claim/leave/auto-claim endpoints and WebSocket broadcasts (table_scene_updated, table_seats_updated).
          • Real /table/:id pages now render the scene as a beautifully-lit room with wood-grain table at center and N dashed seat slots — seat count varies by table type per Anchor 2 (mahogany 8, executive 10, family 6, drafting 8, luncheon 6, strategy 12).
          • Standalone /gather demo refactored to share lib/scenes.js — array order preserved so all hard-coded indices still resolve correctly. Demo works identically.
          • SceneEditorModal: used both as full modal (Edit Scene from TableView) and inline (Customize scene optional in CreateTableModal).
          • Avatar tier namespace reserved on User (avatar_tier enum: preset|stylized|premium_illustrated|photoreal). Settings shows indicator card with the 2 deferred tiers locked + 'Coming soon'. NO Premium picker, NO upload pipeline, NO paywall — strictly namespace per Anchor 3.

        Backend tests: 17/17 passing in tests/test_iteration_18.py.
        Regression sweep: 101/106 passing across roundtable_api + phase3 + phase4 tests. The 5 failures are pre-existing issues unrelated to Iteration 18 — they hardcode invite code 'HO4IIE6D' which doesn't exist in the dev DB (stale test data from a prior session). My changes did not touch invite preview or AI suggest endpoints.

        Frontend self-test: smoke screenshots confirmed (login → portal → /table/:id) — wood-grain table, 8 dashed seat slots, scene chips, Edit Scene button all rendering as the acceptance criteria spell out. Frontend testing agent NOT run — preserving credits per founder protocol (opt-in).

        Path drift noted silently: primer referenced design_guidelines.md (repo has design_guidelines.json) and treated as canonical — code in index.css is the source of truth for the macOS look anyway.

        Branch: feature/scenes-seats-avatars (not yet pushed — founder uses Save to GitHub for write actions). PR title would be "Iteration 18 — Scenes, Seats & Avatars".

      message: |
        Iteration 18a — bug fixes (founder-requested correctness pass on the seat code).

        Fix 1 — Truncate orphan seats when chair shrinks the table type. SHIPPED.
          • backend/server.py update_table now captures the old scene.table BEFORE the write,
            and when the new scene.table is a different table-id with a smaller seat count
            (per SEAT_COUNTS), it deletes any table_seats rows with seat_index >= new_seat_count
            and broadcasts table_seats_updated alongside table_scene_updated.
          • Same-id swaps (and same-seat-count swaps like mahogany ↔ drafting) skip the
            truncation entirely — no false-positive deletes on cosmetic changes.
          • New tests in TestTableShrinkTruncation:
              - test_shrink_strategy_to_family_truncates_orphan_seats   (PASS)
              - test_same_seat_count_swap_does_not_truncate             (PASS)
            The shrink test seats three users at indices 5/8/10 on a 12-seat strategy table,
            shrinks to a 6-seat family table, and asserts: only seat 5 survives, AND the
            two displaced users can immediately re-claim seats 1 and 2 without first calling
            DELETE /seats/mine. The orphan was cleared on their behalf — the seat metaphor
            stays honest.

        Fix 2 — Auto-clear seat when a member is removed from a table. NO CODE CHANGE NEEDED.
          • Searched the entire backend for `table_members.delete*`. Only one call exists,
            at backend/server.py:932 inside DELETE /api/tables/{id}, which already cascades
            to table_seats.delete_many({table_id}) on line 936 (Iteration 18 work).
          • There is no kick-by-owner endpoint and no self-leave-table endpoint in the
            codebase today. The phantom-seat bug is dormant — it cannot be triggered by
            any current code path.
          • Architectural note for Iteration 19+: when the kick or self-leave endpoint
            ships, mirror the cascade pattern from delete_table:
                await db.table_members.delete_one({"table_id": tid, "user_id": uid})
                await db.table_seats.delete_many({"table_id": tid, "user_id": uid})
                # then broadcast table_seats_updated to remaining members
            I did NOT preemptively add a helper or stub endpoint — that's scope expansion.
            The pattern is documented here so the next iteration can land it cleanly.

        Pass count: 19/19 in tests/test_iteration_18.py (was 17/17). Zero regressions.
        Lint: clean. Backend service running. No frontend changes — Edit Scene still
        renders identically; the truncation happens server-side and arrives at clients
        via the existing table_seats_updated WebSocket handler in TableView.jsx.

        One small adjacent fix: a dead local variable (admin_seats) in an existing Iter 18
        test (test_claim_moves_user) was removed to clear a Ruff F841 warning. Pure deletion,
        no behavior change.

        Branch: still feature/scenes-seats-avatars. Same PR title.
