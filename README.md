## Deploy to Render

```bash
# 1. Set environment variables (see backend/.env.example)
# 2. Connect repo to Render — render.yaml handles both services

# Required env vars:
# MONGO_URL, JWT_SECRET, CORS_ORIGINS
# Optional: VAPID keys, TWILIO creds, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Smart Suggestions)
```

The `render.yaml` at the repo root defines both the backend (Python web service) and frontend (static site).
