# Roundtable_VO — Product Requirements Document

## Original Vision
> "Roundtable_VO is a macOS-styled unified collaboration platform that replaces Slack, WhatsApp, Google Suite, email, and SMS with a single, visually intuitive interface organized around the metaphor of gathering at a table. Built for families, faith communities, project teams, and neighborhoods. Core principle: If you can sit at a table, you can collaborate."

## Core Product Principle (user-emphasized, hard requirement)
**Per-table data isolation.** "Each table will hold all of the info at that table, no bleeding and much easier on the user." When a user views a specific table, they see only that table's members, items, events, and chat — no cross-table contamination.

## User Personas
- **Family steward** — keeps everyone on the same page (events, photos, group chat).
- **Faith community leader** — coordinates a group with shared resources.
- **Project lead** — runs a small team without enterprise overhead.
- **Neighborhood organizer** — keeps neighbors connected.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLite + JWT (httpOnly cookies, bcrypt).
- Frontend: React 19 + react-router-dom + Tailwind + lucide-react + sonner.
- File storage: Local disk-backed uploads under `UPLOAD_ROOT`, with metadata in SQLite.
- Real-time: Native WebSockets (signaling + presence + chat + WebRTC).
- Push: VAPID-based Web Push via pywebpush.
- AI: Claude Sonnet via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### Purpose-based starter templates
- Auto-seed events + items when creating tables based on purpose

## Phase 5 — Implemented (Apr 2026)

### Real WebRTC Walkie-Talkie + Video Calls (Group Support)
- **Backend signaling** via existing WebSocket: `call_start`, `call_join`, `call_leave`, `webrtc_offer`, `webrtc_answer`, `webrtc_ice`, `walkie_talk_state` message types
- **In-memory call tracking**: `active_calls` dict with participants, type, table_id
- **REST endpoint**: `GET /api/calls/active` — list active calls (filterable by table_id)
- **Auto-cleanup**: When user disconnects from WebSocket, they're removed from active calls; empty calls are cleaned up
- **Frontend WebRTC service** (`/app/frontend/src/lib/webrtc.js`): Mesh topology peer connection management, media stream handling, ICE/SDP exchange
- **WalkieView** rewritten: "Join Walkie Room" creates real audio call, push-to-talk mutes/unmutes audio track, shows who's currently talking, walkie_talk_state broadcasts
- **VideoCallOverlay** rewritten: Real video + audio streams, local video PiP, remote peer video grid, proper mute/camera/end controls, supports both outgoing and incoming calls
- **IncomingCallToast** component: Ring tone, caller info, Answer/Decline buttons, 30s auto-dismiss
- **STUN servers**: Google's free STUN (`stun.l.google.com:19302`, `stun1.l.google.com:19302`)

### Web Push Notifications
- **VAPID keys** generated and stored in backend .env
- **Endpoints**: `GET /api/push/vapid-key` (public), `POST /api/push/subscribe`, `POST /api/push/unsubscribe`
- **Push triggers**: Walkie pings, direct messages, and incoming calls (when user is offline/not connected via WebSocket)
- **Service Worker** updated with `push` event listener — shows native browser notification with icon, vibrate, tag
- **Notification click** focuses existing tab or opens app to relevant route (walkie/messages)
- **Frontend**: `push.js` subscription manager, auto-subscribe on login if permission granted, Settings page toggle
- **Dead subscription cleanup**: 404/410 responses auto-remove stale endpoints

### SMS/Email Bridges
- **SMS Bridge (LIVE)**: Twilio integration active with real credentials
  - `POST /api/bridges/sms` sends real SMS via Twilio
  - Twilio error messages surfaced to the user (e.g., "Invalid To Phone Number")
  - Trial account limitation: can only send to verified numbers
  - SMS compose form in Contacts page for off-app contacts with phone numbers
- **Email Bridge (COMING SOON)**: Resend integration infrastructure ready, returns 503 until API key provided
  - "COMING SOON" orange badge displayed on Contacts page
- **`GET /api/bridges/status`** — returns which bridges are configured ({sms_configured: true, email_configured: false})

### Call History (Enhancement)
- **`GET /api/calls/history`** — per-user call logs, last 30 days, sorted newest first
- **`call_logs` SQLite-backed collection** — persists call_id, type, participants, started_at, ended_at, duration_seconds, status
- Calls are logged on `call_start`, participants added on `call_join`, finalized with duration on `call_leave` or WebSocket disconnect
- **CallHistoryView** frontend page at `/call-history` — shows each call with avatar, call type icon (video blue, audio orange), direction (outgoing/incoming/missed), duration, time ago, green redial button
- **Missed calls** highlighted in red
- **One-tap redial** opens VideoCallOverlay with the same target
- Accessible from **Sidebar** (between Walkie Talkie and Apps) and **Dock** (green Calls icon)

### Auto-SMS Notifications (Opt-in)
- **"Text me when I miss something"** — single toggle in Settings
- Users add phone number + enable toggle → get SMS when offline for:
  - Walkie pings directed at them
  - Direct messages they missed
  - New prayer/intention items at their tables
  - Missed incoming calls
  - **Event reminders** — 1 hour before table events (background task checks every 10 min)
- `send_auto_sms_if_offline()` helper checks: user offline, auto_sms=true, phone exists, Twilio configured
- Phone number + auto_sms fields added to user profile (PUT /api/me, GET /api/auth/me)

### Theme System
- **Dark mode is now the default** — new users see dark theme on first visit
- **Soft golden light mode** — replaced stark white with warm golden tint (#FEFCF3 base)
- Theme persists in localStorage (`rt-theme`), toggleable via title bar sun/moon icon

### Preset Avatar Library
- **288 avatar options** — 12 DiceBear styles x 24 unique seeds
- Styles: Adventurer, Classic, Big Ears, Robots, Emoji, Lorelei, Micah, Notion, Peeps, Pixel, Thumbs, Personas
- Avatar picker modal in Settings (click profile image → opens picker)
- "Use Initials" button to revert to letter-based avatars
- Stored as `avatar_url` in user profile

### In-App File Viewer + Co-Viewing
- **FileViewerModal** — opens when clicking shared items on a table
- Supports: images (full preview), videos (inline player), PDFs (embedded viewer with page nav), other (download)
- **"Present to Table"** button — starts co-viewing mode:
  - Presenter's view is broadcast to all table members via WebSocket
  - Videos: play/pause/seek syncs for everyone
  - PDFs: page number syncs
  - Images: same image shown to all
- WebSocket events: `present_start`, `present_sync`, `present_stop`

### Enhanced Onboarding (6-Step, All Skippable)
1. **Welcome** — intro + "Get Started" / "Complete later"
2. **Your Look** — name, seat color, avatar picker (DiceBear)
3. **Stay Connected** — phone number, auto-SMS toggle, push notifications toggle
4. **Your First Table** — create table with name/color/active
5. **Invite People** — generate invite code, share via SMS/email
6. **All Set** — checklist summary of completed/skipped items
- Every step has "Complete later" → marks as skipped
- Completion status stored in localStorage (`rt-onboard-completed`)
- **Portal reminder banner** — gentle nudge for skipped items (avatar, phone, push, table)
- Banner is dismissible with X button

### Soft Delete / Trash System (30-Day Recovery)
- **Soft delete**: All deletes set `deleted_at` timestamp instead of removing data
- **Restore**: `POST /api/trash/restore?collection=X&item_id=Y` — recover any trashed item
- **Trash view**: `GET /api/trash` — see all trashed items grouped by collection
- **Purge**: `DELETE /api/trash/purge` — permanently delete everything in trash
- **Clear All**: Bulk trash available for invites, call history, notifications
- **Supported resources**: invites, emails, messages, call logs, shared items, events, contacts, notifications
- **All list queries** now exclude soft-deleted items (`deleted_at: {$exists: false}`)
- **Frontend**: Red trash icons on every row (invites, contacts), Delete button on emails, Clear buttons on call history and notifications

### Apple-Native CSS Polish (Polish Prompt)
- **Spring easing** (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`) on all interactive elements
- **Glass recipe**: `blur(30px) saturate(180%)` on dock, modals, toasts
- **Hover**: `translateY(-1px)` or `scale(1.02)` with spring on buttons, sidebar items, cards
- **Press**: `scale(0.97)` squish on all buttons
- **Focus rings**: `2px rgba(0,122,255,0.5)` glow with spring transition
- **Active states**: Inner shadow + gradient on primary buttons
- **Traffic lights**: Show symbols (x, -, +) on hover
- **Sidebar**: Lift on hover, spring collapse, blue active glow
- **Dock**: `scale(1.15) translateY(-6px)` magnification, badge pop animation
- **Modals**: Spring entry scale + translateY, glass backdrop
- **Toasts**: Slide-in-right with spring
- **Empty states**: Breathing icon animation (scale pulse)
- **Theme toggle**: Smooth 0.4s crossfade via ease-out
- **Text selection**: System blue `rgba(0,122,255,0.25)`
- **Scroll**: Smooth behavior, stable gutter
- **Text rendering**: `optimizeLegibility`
- **Phone links**: `tel:` and `sms:` styled as blue links

### Twilio Trial UX Hardening
- Error code 21608 (unverified number) returns structured JSON with `verify_url` link
- Frontend can display friendly modal instead of raw error

### Transactional Invite Emails
- `POST /api/invites` now accepts optional `recipient_email`
- If Resend configured + email provided, sends branded HTML invite email with join button + code
- Gracefully degrades if Resend not configured

## Backlog

### Deferred Enhancement (user said "remember, don't build yet")
- **Public "We're praying for X" embeddable widget** — church/community websites embed badge linking to `/join/:code`

### P1
- Prayer reply threads (comments on prayers within the Prayer Wall)
- Table roles management UI
- Activity feed per table (timeline of all table actions)

### P2
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Per-table file/folder browser
- Device contact import
- Analytics dashboard for table owners
- Audit log + soft-delete recovery
- Notification preferences per channel

- **Iteration 15 (Code Quality Review #2):** All critical findings applied — hardcoded secrets removed from 14 test files, websocket_endpoint/suggest_events refactored, all empty catch blocks fixed (0 remaining), test files use env vars via conftest
- **Iteration 16 (Gather Experience Demo — Feb 2026):** Cinematic investor prototype wired up. `/gather` route mounted, Portal launcher banner added, simulation auto-starts on load, `autoSeat` stabilized via `useCallback`. Screenshot smoke-test passed (steps 1→4 progressing in 8s). All 6 tabs (Room Builder, Avatar Seating, Live Table, Explore, Plans, Demo Notes) functional. Frontend testing agent NOT run (skipped to conserve credits per user request).
- **Iteration 17 (Share Demo Link — Feb 2026):** Added "Share Demo" feature for investor pitches. New ShareModal with optional partner name input → generates `/gather?for=PartnerName` URL → one-click clipboard copy with success/error toasts. URL param drives a "Built for [Name]" gold pill badge in the demo header. Verified end-to-end via screenshot tool (3/3 flows passing). Lint clean.
- **Iteration 18 (Scenes, Seats & Avatars — Feb 2026):** Persisted the `/gather` demo's scene architecture onto real `/table/:id` pages.
  - **Backend:** Added `scene` (room/table/tabletop/food/ambiance/music) on `TableIn`/`TableUpdateIn` with `DEFAULT_SCENE` (library/mahogany/meeting/none/warm/off) for new and legacy tables. New `table_seats` SQLite-backed collection with unique `(table_id,seat_index)` and `(table_id,user_id)` indices. Endpoints: `GET /api/tables/{id}/seats`, `POST /api/tables/{id}/seats/claim` (auto-assigns first free if seat_index omitted), `DELETE /api/tables/{id}/seats/mine`. WebSocket broadcasts `table_scene_updated` + `table_seats_updated`. Avatar tier namespace reserved on User (`preset`|`stylized`|`premium_illustrated`|`photoreal`) — only stylized active.
  - **Frontend:** New `lib/scenes.js` shared between standalone `/gather` demo and real tables. Refactored `GatherExperience.jsx` to import from it (demo unchanged). Rebuilt `RoundTableViz.jsx` to render the scene as a beautifully-lit room with wood-grain table and **N fixed seat slots** per Anchor 2 (mahogany 8, executive 10, family 6, drafting 8, luncheon 6, strategy 12). Seat slots are dashed when empty, show DiceBear portraits when claimed, with gold ring on the user's own seat. New `SceneEditorModal.jsx` exporting both controlled `<SceneEditor>` (used inline by CreateTableModal's collapsible "Customize scene (optional)" section) and uncontrolled default modal (used by TableView "Edit Scene" button). `Settings.jsx` shows Avatar Tier indicator card with locked "Coming soon" labels for the deferred tiers — no Premium picker, no upload pipeline, no paywall (namespace only).
  - **Tests:** 17/17 backend pytest cases passing in `backend/tests/test_iteration_18.py` (scene persistence, seat claim/leave/auto/range, avatar tier validation). 101/106 passing on regression sweep — 5 failures are pre-existing (stale invite code `HO4IIE6D` in test fixtures), not Iteration 18 regressions.
- **Iteration 18a (Seat Correctness Pass — Feb 2026):** Two surgical bug fixes on the seat code requested by the founder before sharing the build externally. **Fix 1:** `PUT /api/tables/{id}` now truncates orphan seat claims when the scene's `table` field changes to a smaller-seat-count table (e.g. strategy 12 → family 6). Captures the old `scene.table` before the write, deletes any `table_seats` rows with `seat_index >= new_seat_count`, and broadcasts both `table_scene_updated` and `table_seats_updated`. Same-seat-count swaps (mahogany ↔ drafting, both 8 seats) deliberately skip truncation — no false positives on cosmetic table changes. Two new tests cover both paths. **Fix 2:** Verified that the only `table_members.delete*` call site is in `DELETE /api/tables/{id}`, which already cascades to `table_seats.delete_many` (Iteration 18 work). No kick or self-leave endpoint exists today, so the phantom-seat bug is dormant. Architectural note recorded for Iteration 19+ to mirror the cascade pattern when those endpoints ship. Tests: 19/19 passing (was 17/17). Zero regressions, zero frontend changes.
